AI Usage Summary ü§ñ

This project was developed with assistance from ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5).
AI was used to generate boilerplate code, refactor UI with Material 3 design, write Room queries, design MVVM architecture, and suggest ProGuard rules.
The developer iterated with AI to fix issues such as Room database errors, navigation behaviors, and theming setup.
Final refinements (UI previews, navigation polish, and styling) were manually tested and adjusted.
All generated code was reviewed, debugged, and adapted to ensure correctness.
